# PhotoImporter
Moves photos and videos from a specified folder, into separate folders for photos and videos. The photos and videos are each put in dated folders based on the date taken (for photos) or date created (for videos).
Example:
Import photos and videos from: c:\ToImport
Import photos to: c:\MyPhotos
Import videos to: c:\MyVideos

When imported, c:\MyPhotos will have folders named by date using the photos 'taken' date and c:\MyVideos will have folders named by date using the videos 'created by' date.
